Description: utility for computing hash sums and magnet links
 RHash is a console utility for calculation and verification of magnet links
 and a wide range of hash sums like CRC32, MD4, MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512,
 AICH, ED2K, Tiger, DC++ TTH, BitTorrent BTIH, GOST R 34.11-94, RIPEMD-160,
 HAS-160, EDON-R, Whirlpool and Snefru.
 Hash sums are used to ensure and verify integrity of large volumes of data
 for a long-term storing or transferring.
 .
 Features:
  * Output in a predefined (SFV, BSD-like) or a user-defined format.
  * Can calculate Magnet links.
  * Ability to process directories recursively.
  * Updating hash files (adding hash sums of files missing in the hash file).
  * Portability: the program works the same on Linux, *BSD or Windows.

Description: shared library for hash functions computing
 LibRHash is a professional, portable, thread-safe C library for computing
 magnet links and a wide variety of hash sums, such as CRC32, MD4, MD5, SHA1,
 SHA256, SHA512, AICH, ED2K, Tiger, DC++ TTH, BitTorrent BTIH,
 GOST R 34.11-94, RIPEMD-160, HAS-160, EDON-R, Whirlpool and Snefru.
 Hash sums are used to ensure and verify integrity of large volumes of data
 for a long-term storing or transferring.
 .
 Features:
  * Small and easy to learn interface.
  * Hi-level and Low-level API.
  * Allows calculating of several hash functions simultaneously.
  * Portability: the library works on Linux, *BSD and Windows.
